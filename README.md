# DHBW Identity Provider (IDP) Project

A simple, educational identity provider (IDP) system built with PHP and CodeIgniter. This project is designed as a teaching tool for the Distributed Systems course at DHBW, helping students understand how authentication systems work in practice and how they can be used as external services in distributed applications.

---

## ‚ú® Project Overview

This IDP allows users to:

- Log in with a username and password
- Receive a signed access token
- Use that token to access protected API endpoints

The system simulates real-world token-based authentication (inspired by JWT) and is designed to integrate easily into other distributed apps.

---

## üåê How It Works

### Login & Token Issuance

1. User logs in via `/auth/login` with valid credentials.
2. If valid, the server generates a signed token:
   - `token = base64(payload) + '.' + signature`
   - `signature = HMAC_SHA256(base64(payload), SECRET_KEY)`
3. Token is returned to the frontend and stored in `localStorage`.

### Token Usage

- All protected API requests must include:
  ```http
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ```
- The server verifies the signature using the same secret key.
- If valid, access is granted.

### Token Decoding (client-side)

```bash
echo "<base64payload>" | base64 -d
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Requirements

- PHP >= 8.2
- Composer
- Devcontainers (or Docker with VS Code)

### Run the project

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd idp-app
cp env .env
composer install
php spark serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Visit: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## üéì Classroom Use

### Overview

This project is broken into **6 parts** for collaborative group work:

| Group | Responsibility                               |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | User management API (CRUD endpoints)         |
| 2     | File-based storage (salted password hashing) |
| 3     | Login/authentication and token generation    |
| 4     | Token validation logic (HMAC)                |
| 5     | Frontend logic (login + token handling)      |
| 6     | System bootstrap (.env, default admin)       |

Each group implements their part in isolation and merges it into a shared repository. After integration, the full IDP system is available to all teams for use in their own distributed apps.

### Constraints

- UI is fixed (shared login and user management screen)
- Each group must work independently and use Git
- The final integrated system becomes a shared external IDP

---

## ‚úÖ Using the IDP in Other Projects

### 1. Get a Token

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'
```

### 2. Decode Payload

```bash
echo '<base64payload>' | base64 -d
```

### 3. Validate Token (example using openssl)

```bash
# Extract base64 and signature parts
TOKEN="..."
PAYLOAD=$(echo $TOKEN | cut -d. -f1)
SIG=$(echo $TOKEN | cut -d. -f2)

# Recreate the signature
SECRET="your_shared_secret"
echo -n "$PAYLOAD" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$SECRET"
```

If signature matches, the token is valid.
